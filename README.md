# Neural Network from Scratch

Welcome to the "Neural Network from Scratch" project! In this project, we'll build a simple artificial neural network using NumPy and basic mathematical operations, with matplotlib as visualization and pandas to read our dataset. Using the famous MNIST dataset to train our neural network.

## Overview

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a fundamental concept in machine learning and deep learning. In this project, we'll create a basic feedforward neural network from scratch, without using any deep learning libraries. The purpose of this project is to understand the basics and the math behind neural networks and how to implement them with base level code.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3
- NumPy

You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib

```
