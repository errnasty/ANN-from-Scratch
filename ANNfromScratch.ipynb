    "We can think of each neuron in the network as just a number between 0 - 1. Where the neuron lights up when its value is close to 1 and remains inactive when near 0. We can represent each neuron as an activation function $a_n$ where n is the placement of the neuron along each layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Together with the connections between each neuron in the input layer and 1 neuron of the 2nd hidden layer (784 connections), we can get a formula of $w_1a_1 + w_2a_2 + w_3a_3 ... w_na_n$ where we get the weighted sum of all the activations. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we compute a weighted sum like this, but for this network we want the activation for the neuron to be somewhere between 0 - 1. A common thing to do is to put this weighted sum in a some function that squishes the real number into the range between 0 and 1. We will be using a sigmoid function to squish our formula. \n",

    "$σ(w_1a_1 + w_2a_2 + w_3a_3 ... w_na_n)$\n",

    "$σ(w_1a_1 + w_2a_2 + w_3a_3 ... w_na_n + b)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So far each neuron from the input layer has to be connected to each neuron in the other hidden layers and then they have to be connected to the output layer, this makes our network to have a total of 13,002 total weights and bias to tweak and optimise!!"
